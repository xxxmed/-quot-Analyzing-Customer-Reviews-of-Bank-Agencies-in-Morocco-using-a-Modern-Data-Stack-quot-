For my experience: after having noticed a withdrawal from my Attijariwafabank account of the casa cite djemaa agency in favor of a closed Attijari savings contract (with additional opening and management costs) opened according to them by me in 08/2024 , I dispute it and make a complaint. For three months I have been making complaints without follow-up with the request to provide me with the savings contract that I signed (while knowing that it has been years since I went to this bank so I know that someone has that for me). Still no response, I will make my complaint to Bank al Maghrib and close this account in this establishment which should be avoided at full speed with questionable openings and a blatant lack of transparency.",1,2024-11-26

I came back to Casa for a day before going abroad the next day, my day's schedule was super busy, I had no room for error.
I showed up at the agency around 3 p.m. to sort something out quickly, I found a young man in front of me already waiting for the sales advisor. I inquire, the security agent explains to me that the advisor is on lunch break (no problem, it's normal and understandable).
We wait, 3:20 p.m., the advisor has returned, he processes the young man's request. Once finished, the M. leaves, I sit at the office, the advisor gets up and says to me ""one minute, I'll be back"" then he leaves the agency... okay.
5 minutes later, I go out to check what's going on, the advisor is chatting with a quiet friend.... he sees me waiting for him in front of the door, he comes in... he doesn't apologize,... I tell him a minute it's not 5 minutes.
he tells me ""5min MACHI BEZAF""... we get into the discussion that I've already waited 20min before, that's 25min, break already blah blah... and then he throws me: ""20+5 hia 25min, I'm entitled to 30min, I can get up daba nit nmchi nkémél my break w nkhelik hna""! Dragon ball level cheekiness and rudeness!
Not having time to waste, I avoid wasting any more time hit mamsaliyach, otherwise, I would have spent the afternoon there to clarify this language and these manners! but hey, I adjust my 30 second thing to more than 30 min in the end.
For the summary:
* The cashiers: nothing to say each time, very professional and hardworking!
* Former sales advisor RAJAA a gem! smile and availability, nothing to say.
* The current advisor: lazy and lazy!... Rudeness, lack of professionalism, vulgarity, zero courtesy, lack of interpersonal intelligence, immature... difficult to see him in a customer relations position or to imagine him evolving in the banking sector.",1,2024-02-10

Attijariwafa Bank,Attijariwafa Bank,"RWGF+H53, Khemisset, Morocco","I transferred my money from Chaabi bank to waffabank and unfortunately I am starting to regret it.
-ts the services are paid (obligated to take a bank card which we pay every month even if we have not had the possibility of recovering it at the bank and it is no longer available), withdrawals from the account that we don't even know what that means.
-confidentiality is not there, when we are at the counter (for whatever reason, withdrawal, deposit, etc.) the bank employees who receive us sometimes chat with acquaintances of theirs who don't even do not part of bank employees... therefore obliged to share with them our desires and transactions😔 in spite of ourselves.
-some customers pass by with others, even though they have just arrived and we don't tell them anything😡 it's just annoying.
I'm thinking about returning to Banque Chaabi!

In general: Distributor sometimes dysfunctional, or not sufficiently stocked due to the very high traffic due to its location just opposite door 6 of Soukl7add.

The staff is incredibly rude and seems too out of their depth to help customers normally. Instead of being helpful and customer friendly, it seems like they are just trying to impress, which is definitely not professional.

I am seriously considering switching banks because I believe customers should be treated respectfully. In Europe, banks are much more customer-oriented and know how important it is to be polite and helpful. There is still a lot to learn here in terms of customer focus and service. The problem is also that the people who work in that bank think that the bank belongs to their father. They don't know that they are only employees of the bank. Selling a show with nothing is very low.

Hopefully the bank will take this feedback to heart, because I cannot recommend this bank to others. I will also change banks because entrusting my money to such people is far too low for me.",1,2024-12-25

Today I went to the said agency to pay visa fees, I arrived at 2:30 p.m. the security agent stopped me to tell me:  while the cashier was still there. (Is that his job already)?
At the agency, there was an operations manager, a cashier, and the agency manager. I then went to the manager, to find out if the cashier couldn't do this operation, he told me no, you have to wait for the person who is taking their break...
Ok since I'm not from the city of Tangier, and since it's my last day to submit my file, I didn't want to take the risk and go out and look for another agency, in the meantime the guy came back to the cash register (he is the same person), carried out a cash transaction for a customer. All this is happening before my eyes (the security agent made me understand that the person who takes care of this type of operation is not the same person at the cash register.
For a 5 minute operation, I spent more than 45 minutes waiting for the same person I found at the entrance.

BMCE Bank,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,"140 Bd Hassan II, Casablanca 20320, Morocco","BMCE Service in Fquih Ben Salah & Khouribga: Absolutely Unacceptable! 😡👎 (10/10 BAD!)
My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! 😠
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! 💔 I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""Désolé Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup 🌍⚽️, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. 📉
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. 🏢❌
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be 💸, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality 🤨⚖️❓ have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable.

BMCE Bank,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,"140 Bd Hassan II, Casablanca 20320, Morocco","BMCE Service in Fquih Ben Salah & Khouribga: Absolutely Unacceptable! 😡👎 (10/10 BAD!)
My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! 😠
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! 💔 I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""Désolé Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup 🌍⚽️, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. 📉
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. 🏢❌
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be 💸, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality 🤨⚖️❓ have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! 😡🛠️",1,2025-04-22

I would like to bring to your attention several malfunctions which significantly impact the quality of your service.

First of all, the order of passage is not respected, which leads to long, unjustified waits. In addition, managers do not demonstrate professionalism, which further complicates user management.

Then, your telephone customer service is unreachable. I have tried to contact you several times, but no one responds, making any request for information or follow-up extremely difficult.

Finally, the touchscreen terminal located outside is out of service. It is old and no longer works properly, which causes inconvenience to users. It would be necessary to consider its repair or replacement in order to improve the user experience.

BMCE Bank,Bank of Africa,"MJQ5+569, Bd Abdellah Ibn Yassine, Mohammédia, Morocco","I have never seen such poor service as that of this bank. Absolutely avoid!!! She never answers the phone: I can't go to the agency, so for a week now, I've been trying to contact them from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. with no response and the group's customer service can't handle my requests, they just give me the number of my agency to contact them. The bank does not keep its promises. Unjustified withdrawals: although the account and card were free for the first year, she still debited my account a week after opening my account. Fortunately I recorded the entire conversation the day I opened my account in Visio. And even despite that, they do not respond to my complaints, they say that they have received it and that they will process it as soon as possible (perhaps in Morocco this means never or infinitely).

For 3 years I have been requesting an access code to manage my account from my platform. I never got a response. In October 2023 during the All Saints holidays, I took the whole family. Knowing that I have the sum of 130,000 dirhams in my account, I went to withdraw a small amount. I learned that my account has been locked since April 2023, 6 months ago. Without my being informed, my account was hacked, the sum of 120,000 dirhams were drained from it by scammers. Seeing that I was not the originator of his transfers, they blocked the account late. In a single day there were 5 transactions of 20,000 dirhams each.
When I asked the director of the agency for explanations. Aucubrvteponse from him and no advice on how to get my money back. The only thing I could do is file a complaint at the police station and the Berkane court.
When I returned to France, I sent 25 emails without receiving a response from them. I alerted the intermediary agency in Orleans, also sent emails to their colleagues at the Berkane agency and received no response from this director. They advised him to file a complaint against the agency and don director. I conclude that this agency is in on it. Involve the Berkane judicial police, it can only be them who are behind this scam.

This misunderstanding not only caused a waste of time, but the attitude of the employee I spoke with was unprofessional when he placed the blame on me. As a customer, I expected more consideration and reliable information to avoid this type of incident.

The extent of impudence, there is no more degrading way to ""greet"" a customer.

At 9:23 the entrance door was still only half open because the cleaning lady was still cleaning at the entrance.

Out of politeness, I stopped and asked the cashier if it was open yet, to which she replied in the affirmative.

So I was just about to enter when the ""security guard"" appeared out of nowhere and stood in my way.

He didn't respond to my greeting, which in itself is extremely cheeky, but that's not how we're used to ""security"" in this country, and he boldly asked what I wanted. ""I want to go into the bank."" Apparently that wasn't enough for him, because the question was now asked the other way around: ""What exactly do you want here...?"".

Since banking matters are generally no one's business, especially not some third-class security guard who thinks he's Dirty Harry, I answer again: ""I want to go to the bank."" Discreet, normal tone. This leaves him unconcerned and he boldly asks for the third time. As a cultured person you give in at some point, and I then told him that I would like to transfer my account from Casablanca here.

That worked, and then got me a seat at the desk of the branch manager of this miserable branch.

As soon as I sat down I was left alone. When the lady came back, I asked her who this person - security guard - was and why I was treated so condescendingly even though there were already people inside. Then the cool comment: ""That can't be right, you can't say anything against the good man.""

This sat with me!! I stood up and simply said that I had no business here and that I would be better off changing banks.

As already mentioned - it's getting boring - you don't ask for much, but there should be a minimum of respect.

The reincarnation of indignity. Thank you Societe General Settat Vol. Hassan II.

An embittered, haughty woman who didn't even want to respond to the hello which told me that the bank was closed and that she couldn't do anything for me.
I explain to him that via my banking application the withdrawal was made but that no ticket was given by the counter (the zipper). This woman starts screaming and asks me to leave quickly, a dark-haired woman wearing a pink shirt, she starts screaming while explaining that she doesn't care.
I kept my calm and left wishing this woman all the misfortune in the world.
You are the image of the bank, Crédit du Maroc should be ashamed of employing a woman with a lack of professionalism, she should not be confronted with the public because her behavior and her image are the showcase of this bank.
Many people are looking for work and those with a smile.",1,2023-07-20

Being a resident of this city but resident in France, I wanted to withdraw money from this ATM. It is then that the counter confirms the transaction but does not give me any ticket. So I decided to contact the banking staff who were inside.
An embittered, haughty woman who didn't even want to respond to the hello which told me that the bank was closed and that she couldn't do anything for me.
I explain to him that via my banking application the withdrawal was made but that no ticket was given by the counter (the zipper). This woman starts screaming and asks me to leave quickly, a dark-haired woman wearing a pink shirt, she starts screaming while explaining that she doesn't care.
I kept my calm and left wishing this woman all the misfortune in the world.

Crédit du Maroc,Crédit du Maroc,"Av. Fal Ould Oumeir, Rabat, Morocco","So clearly we can't just give 0.
Customer since 2008 in this bank with current account, currency, savings I can give you an idea of ​​the circus that you will encounter there.

Positive point: Some nice agents by their nature and not the agency, unfortunately they end up leaving.

Dark spots:
-Reception, customer relations. Poorly trained agents, borderline unpleasant and condescending, completely unreachable remotely (telephone, whatsapp, text messages, emails... Telepathy!).
Unless you are retired and want to travel every day for any need, avoid this bank, and above all this agency would be a good thing for your mental health. Hanout atmosphere.
-Poorly adapted system: requesting an amortization table took 2 months, because the agency has to send a request to Casablanca and bla bla they go around in circles, so imagine having to respond elsewhere within a certain time frame.
-Bank customer since 2008, I have never received a promised call to respond to a need expressed to the agency, and the agent each time asks for my number which has never changed for 20 years which is on its screen
-No hierarchy: no way to escalate anything to anyone, the online site and the application are useless for reporting a problem because there is no monitoring, you can write as much as you want.... nada .
-No operation will take you less than 20 minutes, so be sure you won't have to do anything afterwards.
-The bank changes its clauses discreetly and illegally: I learn that I cannot take out a loan for no reason (probably because I am black). I contacted the business center then the management who ended up telling me yes you will have it but I asked again I was told ""the final agreement is still not out"" hhh clowns. Imagine if I had no other alternatives.

Brief
Soon I will close all accounts.

Update: there remains a current account, soon to be closed to put this mishap far behind.",1,2024-12-24
Crédit du Maroc,Crédit du Maroc,"Av. Fal Ould Oumeir, Rabat, Morocco","Bj,
Big disagreements with the agency head at C du M today.
Impossible to request euros if convertible account?
I didn't have this information. They explained that the rules had been changed.
Customer for 25, the staff leaves you unable to exchange Dhs for euros.
Instead of simply saying that the operation would be possible via a currency exchange office.
On the other hand, I just learned today that my convertible DHS account has been in debt since 2021... So I have a debt to Morocco's credit. The agios plus bank charges each period.
Uninformed, I am told that I will have to pay the various costs.
No information given to the customer.
And after a misunderstanding on my part regarding the fees for 2023 and 2024 we tell you: the account is frozen.
So if I don't pay for 10 years, the M' credit will offer me the account keeping fees and the agios.
Nice, but I don't think it's normal to look for the new banking rules as a customer.
We tell you that all this is written in the bank bulletin.
Dsl but I did not choose to be a bank employee and therefore impossible to have this information.
In another scenario Please, I asked several months ago why I had to pay several monthly payments in the same month on a loan.
A letter from the bank was indeed sent but no follow-up to the file.
In short, I was used to more generous services.
This is my dissatisfaction......especially since the address changes have been made.
In this bank it would be necessary to review the customer management policy regarding the new regulations and anticipate the difficulties in which customers might encounter.
Kind regards

For this we headed to cih chefchaouni agency the agency was almost empty there was only one lady in front of us who wanted to open a bank account. The lady's turn arrived and she left to fill out the necessary forms for this action suddenly the lady who takes care of opening the accounts left the lady in her office and walked towards us to ask us our needs we told him that we want to open a bank account then he asked my brother to show him his identity card which he did, to our great astonishment he told us that this card is obsolete knowing that all the information is clear and that it cannot open a bank account with this card. I told her the card is in good condition then she told us to wait. After a good half hour she called us to tell us that she cannot scan the said CIN. I told her to at least try but she refused!!!!!!! We immediately went to a competing bank nearby who opened a bank account for us without any problem!!!!!!

CIH Bank,CIH BANK,"Lot N. 17, N1, Temara 12000, Morocco","It is with very sincere regret that I share my experience with the bank that I speak about my recent stint within the so-called prestigious CIH bank. Indeed, my experience was dampened by immeasurable expectations, accentuated by the unannounced absence of certain members of staff. What should have been a simple banking formality unfortunately turned into hours or even an entire day wasted. Is there a specific purpose behind this time spent on customers without the slightest consideration? Why are these followers left in a desolate state of uncertainty waiting patiently without knowing whether their requests would be answered or not? As a result, this disorganization directly impacts the one-off commitments of those loyal to the bank, often leading to breaches of personal and professional obligations. Obviously, the attitude of the hierarchy called into question in its entirety, from the highest paid executive to the employee whose income seems insufficient to provide for the necessities of life, in short, the internal atmosphere diffuses in the air a sort of arrogance at all levels which only intensifies the inconvenience of customers, and reveals a striking gap between the reality experienced daily by these faithful and the overall strategy of the bank. So it’s normal to ask the question, why not organize yourself better? leave ambiguity lingering? Keeping up a mystery? .. what is certain is that today, the CIH bank would have no choice but to seriously re-examine its internal organization, with an emphasis on punctuality, transparency regarding the availability of agents , and improving working conditions for all of its staff. In the hope that this constructive criticism encourages the CIH bank to reevaluate its practices, I cannot repress a deep sadness at the inconvenience suffered by us (former clients), who had chosen to entrust our trust to this revered institution.",1,2024-02-27

CIH Bank,CIH BANK,"Lot N. 17, N1, Temara 12000, Morocco","It is with very sincere regret that I share my experience with the bank that I speak about my recent stint within the so-called prestigious CIH bank. Indeed, my experience was dampened by immeasurable expectations, accentuated by the unannounced absence of certain members of staff. What should have been a simple banking formality unfortunately turned into hours or even an entire day wasted. Is there a specific purpose behind this time spent on customers without the slightest consideration? Why are these followers left in a desolate state of uncertainty waiting patiently without knowing whether their requests would be answered or not? As a result, this disorganization directly impacts the one-off commitments of those loyal to the bank, often leading to breaches of personal and professional obligations. Obviously, the attitude of the hierarchy called into question in its entirety, from the highest paid executive to the employee whose income seems insufficient to provide for the necessities of life, in short, the internal atmosphere diffuses in the air a sort of arrogance at all levels which only intensifies the inconvenience of customers, and reveals a striking gap between the reality experienced daily by these faithful and the overall strategy of the bank. So it’s normal to ask the question, why not organize yourself better? leave ambiguity lingering? Keeping up a mystery? .. what is certain is that today, the CIH bank would have no choice but to seriously re-examine its internal organization, with an emphasis on punctuality, transparency regarding the availability of agents , and improving working conditions for all of its staff. In the hope that this constructive criticism encourages the CIH bank to reevaluate its practices, I cannot repress a deep sadness at the inconvenience suffered by us (former clients), who had chosen to entrust our trust to this revered institution.",1,2024-02-27

I am extremely disappointed to see that your bank's customer service is so poor. I expect banks to provide superior services, especially when it comes to answering calls from their customers.

I hope you will take the necessary steps to improve the quality of service at this branch. If this situation persists, I will be forced to look for another bank that offers superior services.

After receiving a group of packages, I paid the postman sums of money for each package I received, but I was surprised that I was not given an invoice or any document proving the amounts paid, even though I requested that from the employee in charge. As you know, submitting the invoice is a right guaranteed to me as a consumer under Law No. 31.08 related to consumer protection, which stipulates in its Article 15 that it is mandatory to submit an invoice or document proving the process of performance or service. This caused an escalation in communication on the part of your employee, and he began to procrastinate and refuse to deliver my packages (9 packages) in collusion with his direct boss.
Therefore, I ask you to intervene to correct this situation and enable me to receive invoices for the amounts paid. And my packages that the postman refused to deliver to me. Pending your response, I hope you take the necessary measures to avoid a recurrence of such an incident in the future.

They have the sign hanging next to it saying “Working for customer service is our priority”, but they don't even know how to say good morning. With bitter faces and no desire to work.
Today, Tuesday, November 21, at 10:45, a lady helped me at ticket office 3. To was still talking to tell her what she wanted, and she already called the next number, with arrogance and a lack of education... incredible.

Have someone give them training on basic principles of customer service, and explain to them that that is why this agency exists and that their jobs depend on us, the clients.
If Morocco does not advance it is because of the lack of seriousness in matters like this.
And unfortunately, most people leave with their heads bowed, because they do not know how to file complaints or claims.
And that is the force on which irresponsible workers rely: people's ignorance.
